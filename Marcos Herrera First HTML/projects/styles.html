		<h2>Recognizing A Typical Metal Artist</h2>
		
		<!--I used a bold on the words "Heavy metal",put small on "fullness"-->
		
		<p style="font-family:'century gothic';color:red;text-align:center"><b>Heavy metal</b> is traditionally characterized by loud distorted guitars, emphatic rhythms, dense bass-and-drum sound, and vigorous vocals. Metal subgenres variously emphasize, alter, or omit one or more of these attributes. New York Times critic Jon Pareles writes, "In the taxonomy of popular music, heavy metal is a major subspecies of hard-rock—the breed with less syncopation, less blues, more showmanship and more brute force.The typical band lineup includes a drummer, a bassist, a rhythm guitarist, a lead guitarist, and a singer, who may or may not be an instrumentalist.Keyboard instruments are sometimes used to enhance the <small>fullness</small> of the sound.</p>
